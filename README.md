# GenName

Here comes my Delphi version (with sources) to some web tool, that allowed to generate names for games, books, poetry etc. It contains "databases" for generating many different names sets, including fantasty ones, both more and less known, and human names in many languages or from many culture types.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

This program allows name generation in three different modes. Play a little bit with different dictionary files to catch the difference.

Program comes with an extended editor, which allows you to add or update existing dictionary files.

### Database authors

Names of original databases / dictionary files contents, in order of appearance: Johan Danforth, Laurent Dionisi and Nathalie Hebert. That's all about fantasy names. As for human names, with the exception for two dictionary files for an extinct races (Gauls and Vikings, made by Johan Danforth), I'm myself an author of all these databases. Keep in mind that certain dictionary files maybe even twenty years old!

Where it was possible, I carefully marked author or maker of original database, that I used for creating my own dictionary files. However, it was not possible in case of all files. If you are an author of such file and you are not mentioned, fell free to contact me and I'll be more than happy to add your name to the list or remove dictionary file upon your request.

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **1 October 2008**. Last time `.exe` file built: **6 January 2013**.

**You're only getting project's source code and nothing else! You need to find all missing Delphi components by yourself.**

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.

Keep in mind, that both comments and names (variables, object) are in Polish. I didn't find enough time and determination to translated them as well. I only translated strings.

### Sources of names data

I've said twice, that this project is abandoned. If I ever decide to resurect it, it will be rewritten to be a fully functional web service. For this purpose (if it will ever happen) I may need an updated database of names.

Here are some links to consider:

- [studentsoftheworld.info](http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/penpals/stats.php3).

### Possible changes

If I'll ever consider updating this project then it will be rewritten as a website, in PHP. It will have a separate git repository, which I'll eventually link here. This project, in Delphi, is abandoned as for me and as written in above chapter.

When rewriting project, some changes may be considered:

1. [Namespedia](http://www.namespedia.com/details/Studnik): adding selected name details screen with:

    - name reversed,
    - possible anagrams,
    - possible misspells,
    - letters count with vowels and consonants count and precentage.
    
These numbers and data seems pretty useless, but the general idea of adding such details screen somehow convinces me. To be discussed.
