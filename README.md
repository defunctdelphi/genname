# GenName

Here comes my Delphi version (with sources) to some web tool, that allowed to generate names for games, books, poetry etc. It contains "databases" for generating many different names sets, including fantasty ones, both more and less known, and human names in many languages or from many culture types.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

Keep in mind, that both comments and names (variables, object) are in Polish. I didn't find enough time and determination to translated them as well. I only translated strings.

**You're only getting project's source code and nothing else! You need to find all missing Delphi components by yourself.**

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **1 October 2008**. Last time `.exe` file built: **6 January 2013**.

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.
